⏺ Based on the information gathered, here's how Metabase handles database connection pooling:

  Metabase uses C3P0 as its connection pooling solution for both the application database and data warehouse databases. The implementation is
  split between several key modules:

  1. External library dependency:
    - Metabase uses a custom library called metabase/connection-pool (version 1.2.0) defined in deps.edn, which provides a wrapper around C3P0.
    - It also directly depends on com.mchange/c3p0 (version 0.10.1).
  2. Application Database Connection Pool:
    - The setup is handled in src/metabase/db/connection_pool_setup.clj
    - It creates a connection pool for the application database (the database that stores Metabase metadata, users, dashboards, etc.)
    - The pool is configured with sensible defaults like automatic connection testing and idle connection timeouts
    - Includes a DbActivityTracker that monitors connection activity for health checking
  3. Data Warehouse Connection Pools:
    - For external databases that Metabase connects to (data warehouses), pool management is in src/metabase/driver/sql_jdbc/connection.clj
    - Each database connection gets its own dedicated connection pool
    - Pools are cached in the database-id->connection-pool atom to avoid creating new pools unnecessarily
    - When database details change, the pool is automatically invalidated and recreated
  4. Pool Configuration:
    - For the application database, configuration is in application-db-connection-pool-props
    - For data warehouses, configuration is in data-warehouse-connection-pool-properties
    - Settings include max pool size, idle timeout, connection testing, and unreturned connection timeout
    - Environment variables and settings control pool sizes (e.g., MB_APPLICATION_DB_MAX_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE)
  5. Key Features:
    - Connection validation through testConnectionOnCheckout
    - Automatic detection and reset of stale or broken connections
    - SSH tunnel integration for remote databases
    - Monitoring via activity tracking (timestamps of recent connections)
    - Password and auth management, including Azure managed identity support
  6. Default Pool Sizes:
    - Data warehouse max pool size defaults to 15 (configurable via settings)
    - Application DB pool size is configurable via environment variables
  7. Security Features:
    - Unreturned connection timeouts prevent pool exhaustion if code doesn't properly close connections
    - Optional debug stack traces for tracking unreturned connections
    - Password expiration and renewal handling

  The code uses a thread-safe approach to pool management, ensuring that only one pool exists per database and that old pools are properly
  destroyed when configurations change or connections break.

⏺ Search(pattern: "PDF_EXPORT", path: "frontend/src/metabase/dashboard/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx")…

  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Task(I need to find the specific implementation for how dashboard cards are rendered in PDF exports in Metabase. I've already found the       …
      save-dashboard-pdf.ts file, which handles the process of creating the PDF. Now I need to find how the dashboard content is prepared for PDF
      export. Specifically, look for code that deals with the DASHBOARD_PDF_EXPORT_ROOT_ID in the Dashboard.tsx component or any other relevant
      code. Please search for any implementation details related to PDF export of dashboard cards in the Metabase codebase.)

  ⎿  Done (6 tool uses · 42.7k tokens · 32.1s)


⏺ The process for rendering dashboard cards in PDF exports in Metabase involves several key components:

  1. Initiating the Export:
    - When a user clicks the "Export as PDF" button, the export process is triggered from either ExportAsPdfButton.tsx or ExportPdfMenuItem.tsx
    - Both components call the saveDashboardPdf function with the dashboard's name and a selector for the content to export
  2. Selecting Content:
    - The main dashboard content is contained in an element with the ID DASHBOARD_PDF_EXPORT_ROOT_ID ("Dashboard-Parameters-And-Cards-Container")
    - This element contains both the dashboard parameters and all dashboard cards
  3. Rendering to Image:
    - Metabase uses the html2canvas-pro library to capture the dashboard DOM as an image
    - Special CSS is applied during capture to ensure proper styling (defined in save-chart-image.ts)
    - The library handles converting DOM elements to a canvas including charts, tables, and other visualizations
  4. Smart Pagination:
    - For multi-page dashboards, Metabase uses an intelligent algorithm to determine optimal page breaks
    - The findPageBreakCandidates and getPageBreaks functions identify good places to split content between pages
    - Table cards allow for page breaks between rows via the data-allow-page-break-after attribute
  5. PDF Generation:
    - The jspdf library converts the captured images into a PDF document
    - Headers are added to each page with the dashboard name
    - Dashboard parameters are included at the top of the first page
    - Page breaks are applied while maintaining readability and preventing cards from being split awkwardly
  6. Special Handling for Large Content:
    - For dashboards that span multiple pages, the algorithm ensures:
        - Dashboard cards aren't split across pages unless specifically allowed (like tables)
      - Pages maintain reasonable aspect ratios appropriate for PDF viewing
      - The last page is properly sized to prevent horizontal trimming

  The entire process happens client-side in the browser, with no server-side rendering involved. The PDF generation leverages modern browser
  capabilities to capture the rendered dashboard exactly as it appears on screen, maintaining styling, charts, and layout.

      how query caching works in Metabase.)

  ⎿  Done (3 tool uses · 40.9k tokens · 21.1s)


⏺ Based on my research, here's how Metabase implements caching for query results:

  Core Components and Settings

  1. Configuration Settings:
    - enable-query-caching: Toggle to enable/disable query caching entirely (default: true)
    - query-caching-max-kb: Maximum size of cached results per query in KB (default: 2000KB/2MB)
    - query-caching-max-ttl: Maximum time to keep cached results in seconds (default: 35 days)
  2. Database Storage:
    - Metabase stores query results in the query_cache table in the application database
    - The query cache is identified by a hash of the normalized query
    - Results are serialized, compressed, and optionally encrypted before storage
  3. Cache Backend:
    - The default backend is :db (application database)
    - Implemented in metabase.query-processor.middleware.cache-backend.db
    - The backend can be configured via the MB_QP_CACHE_BACKEND environment variable

  Caching Process

  1. Cache Eligibility:
    - Caching is opt-in through a :cache-strategy in the query
    - The strategy determines cache TTL and invalidation rules
    - Only queries that ran longer than a specified duration are cached
    - Results must be smaller than query-caching-max-kb when serialized
  2. Serialization Process:
    - Uses the nippy library for efficient binary serialization
    - Applies GZIP compression to reduce storage size
    - Has a structured format: [initial-metadata row-1 row-2 ... row-n final-metadata]
    - Encrypts data if database encryption is enabled
  3. Cache Retrieval:
    - Before running a query, Metabase checks for a valid cache entry
    - If found, validates the cache version matches current format
    - For valid cache hits, streams results without executing the query
    - Attaches metadata to indicate the results came from cache
  4. Cache Invalidation:
    - TTL-based expiration based on query strategy
    - For queries with a TTL strategy, TTL is calculated based on execution time
    - Automatic purging of old entries beyond query-caching-max-ttl
    - Enterprise version offers more invalidation strategies
  5. Maintenance:
    - Background task purges outdated cache entries
    - Includes safeguards against excessive memory usage during serialization
    - Error handling to prevent cache-related issues from affecting query execution

  The implementation is highly optimized with features like:
  - Efficient binary streaming of results
  - Parallel processing via the BatchTool
  - Intelligent handling of large result sets
  - Support for different backends in enterprise versions

  The caching system is primarily client-side (browser-to-Metabase), handled entirely in the query processor middleware stack, and operates
  transparently to both users and connected databases.

  ⎿  Read 302 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Based on my research, here's how Metabase handles JWT authentication:

  Core JWT Authentication Flow

  1. Setup and Configuration:
    - JWT authentication is an enterprise feature in Metabase
    - Configuration settings include JWT shared secret, identity provider URI, and attribute mappings
    - Users can configure JWT through the Admin Settings UI or environment variables
    - Key settings include jwt-shared-secret, jwt-identity-provider-uri, and attribute mappings
  2. Authentication Process:
    - When a user attempts to access a protected resource without being logged in, they are redirected to /auth/sso
    - The request retains the original URL in the return_to parameter
    - The user is redirected to the Identity Provider's login page configured in jwt-identity-provider-uri
    - After successful authentication at the IdP, the IdP generates a JWT token
    - The IdP sends the user back to Metabase with this token: /auth/sso?jwt=TOKEN&return_to=ORIGINAL_URL
  3. Token Validation and Processing:
    - Metabase receives the JWT token and verifies it using the shared secret
    - Token validation includes checking the signature and expiration (3-minute validity window)
    - From the token payload, Metabase extracts user information using configured attribute mappings:
        - Email address (default key: "email")
      - First name (default key: "first_name")
      - Last name (default key: "last_name")
      - Groups (default key: "groups") if group sync is enabled
  4. User Creation/Retrieval:
    - If JWT user provisioning is enabled, Metabase creates new user accounts automatically
    - For existing users, Metabase updates login attributes from the JWT
    - Users created via JWT are flagged with sso_source: "jwt" to track their authentication method
  5. Group Synchronization:
    - If group synchronization is enabled, Metabase updates the user's group memberships
    - Admin can configure mappings between JWT groups and Metabase groups
    - Group mappings are stored as JSON with JWT group names as keys and arrays of Metabase group IDs as values
    - Only mapped groups are synchronized; existing memberships in non-mapped groups are preserved
  6. Session Creation:
    - After successful authentication, Metabase creates a session for the user
    - The session is stored in the database and returned as cookies
    - The user is redirected to their original destination URL

  Security Features

  1. Token Security:
    - JWT tokens are signed using the shared secret
    - Tokens have a 3-minute validity window
    - Support for standard JWT claims (iss, sub, aud, exp, etc.)
    - Login attributes are extracted from the token but standard claims are filtered out
  2. User Account Management:
    - Users authenticated via JWT cannot use password login by default
    - Password login can be completely disabled for all users via settings
    - JWT authentication can be enabled/disabled globally
  3. Embedding Applications:
    - When using the Embedding SDK, JWT can be used for authenticating embedded dashboards
    - Supports stateless authentication for embedded applications

  The entire JWT integration is part of Metabase's enterprise SSO features, which makes it suitable for organizations that need to integrate with
   identity providers like Auth0, Microsoft Azure AD, or custom JWT providers.

  ⎿  Read 335 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Based on my research into Metabase's codebase, here's how database permissions are enforced in the query processor:

  Core Permission Enforcement Architecture

  1. Permission Middleware
    - Permissions are enforced through middleware in the query processor pipeline
    - The primary enforcement happens in metabase.query-processor.middleware.permissions
    - This middleware runs early in the query processing flow to validate permissions before query execution
  2. Permission Calculation
    - The system identifies all database resources (tables/schemas) referenced in a query
    - Different permission requirements are calculated for:
        - Native (SQL) queries: Require full database native access permissions
      - MBQL queries: Require permissions for each referenced table
      - Nested queries: Recursively check permissions for all source queries
  3. Permission Types
    - Two main permission types are checked:
        - perms/view-data: Ability to view/read data from tables
      - perms/create-queries: Ability to create queries (query-builder or native)
    - Permissions can be granted at table level or database level

  Specific Permission Checks

  1. For Ad-hoc Queries
    - Extracts all source tables via query->source-table-ids
    - Checks if the current user has appropriate permissions for each table
    - For native queries, checks for full native query access to the database
  2. For Card-based Queries
    - When a query uses a saved question (Card) as a source:
        - Checks if the user has read access to the Card's collection
      - Doesn't require database access if the user has Card access
      - Recursively checks permissions for any nested Cards
  3. For Sandboxed Users
    - Enterprise Edition adds data sandboxing (row-level restrictions)
    - gtap-perms (Group Table Access Policies) modify effective permissions
    - These permissions are stored in special ::perms key in the query
    - The middleware strips these keys to prevent user manipulation
  4. Inactive Tables
    - Special validation prevents queries against inactive tables
    - This check happens before permission checks
    - Shows different error messages based on user's permissions

  Security Protections

  1. Query Manipulation Protection
    - Filters out any user-supplied ::perms keys from queries
    - Removes :qp/stage-is-from-source-card keys from user queries
    - Prevents users from bypassing security by manipulating query structures
    - Blocks users from claiming a native query was compiled from MBQL
  2. Query Permissions Middleware
    - Runs for all queries except public/embedded queries
    - Throws permission exceptions when access is denied
    - Provides detailed error information with required permissions
  3. Embedding/Public Sharing
    - For public/embedded dashboards, permissions are checked at creation time
    - Embedded queries have different permission validation paths
    - JWT authentication can provide temporary access to specific resources

  The overall approach is comprehensive, layered, and handles various edge cases like nested queries, sandboxing, and source cards. The system
  balances security with flexibility by checking permissions at the most appropriate level (collection permissions for saved questions vs. data
  permissions for ad-hoc queries).

  ⎿  Read 103 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Based on my research, here's a comprehensive explanation of how data sandboxing is implemented in Metabase:

  Core Concept

  Data sandboxing in Metabase is an enterprise feature that allows for row-level and column-level security, enabling different users to see
  different subsets of data from the same tables. Sandboxes are implemented through "Group Table Access Policies" (GTAPs) - rules that determine
  what data members of specific groups can access.

  Key Components of the Implementation

  1. Data Model: Group Table Access Policies
    - Stored in the sandboxes table in Metabase's application database
    - Each GTAP connects a permissions group to a table with filtering rules
    - Can be based on either attribute filtering or custom SQL queries
  2. Types of Sandboxing:
    - Basic Sandboxing (Row-Level): Filters table rows based on user attributes
    - Custom Sandboxing (Row and Column-Level): Uses a saved SQL question as a replacement for the table, allowing both row and column
  restrictions
  3. User Attribute Mapping:
    - Each user has "login attributes" stored in their profile
    - Sandboxes map these attributes to parameters in filters or SQL queries
    - This enables dynamic filtering where each user sees only their data

  Implementation Flow in the Query Processor

  1. Permission Detection:
    - When a user runs a query, the middleware checks if they belong to groups with sandboxed tables
    - The enforce-sandbox? function determines if a sandbox should be applied for a user
    - If the user has unrestricted access via another group, sandboxing is bypassed
  2. Query Transformation:
    - The apply-sandboxing middleware detects tables referenced in the query
    - For each table that needs sandboxing, it identifies the appropriate GTAP
    - It then transforms the query by replacing references to original tables with either:
        - A filtered version of the table (basic sandboxing)
      - A subquery using a saved SQL question (custom sandboxing)
  3. Parameter Substitution:
    - For attribute-based sandboxes, user attribute values are inserted into query filters
    - For custom sandboxes, user attribute values are passed as parameters to the underlying SQL queries
    - This ensures users only see rows that match their attributes
  4. Recursive Processing:
    - The system handles nested queries by recursively applying sandboxing transformations
    - Limited to 20 levels of recursion to prevent infinite loops
  5. Metadata Management:
    - Carefully preserves column metadata to ensure query results appear identical to unsandboxed queries
    - Handles column type checking to ensure sandboxes return compatible data types

  Security Enforcement

  1. Sandboxes Override:
    - Sandboxing is applied as a middleware in the query processor pipeline
    - When activated, it tracks granted permissions and augments the query processing context
    - Adds ::perms keys to queries to pass sandbox information through the pipeline
  2. Conflict Resolution:
    - System detects and prevents multiple sandboxes for the same table/user combination
    - Ensures one group can't bypass another group's restrictions
  3. Protection from SQL Bypass:
    - Native SQL queries don't honor sandboxes (they go directly to the database)
    - System prevents sandbox bypass by:
        - Revoking "Native" query permissions for sandboxed users
      - Collection permissions to restrict access to saved SQL questions that could reveal restricted data

  Technical Implementation Details

  1. Caching:
    - The system caches sandbox calculations for performance
    - Uses the qp.store/cached mechanism to avoid recalculating sandboxes within a request
  2. Query Result Processing:
    - Post-processes query results to merge metadata from original tables
    - Adds an is_sandboxed flag to result metadata for tracking
  3. Performance Optimizations:
    - Uses efficient query transforms rather than running additional queries
    - Caches metadata for tables to avoid repeated preprocessing
  4. Data Type Safety:
    - Validates that column types in sandboxed results match the original table
    - Ensures proper type conversion for user attribute values (string to numeric when needed)

  The implementation is designed to be both secure and performant, with careful attention to maintaining the expected behavior of Metabase
  features while enforcing data restrictions. The system integrates deeply with Metabase's permissions framework while adding the specialized
  capabilities needed for row and column-level security.

     - `/docs/configuring-metabase/timezones.md` and `/docs/troubleshooting-guide/timezones.md`: Documentation on timezone configuration

     The analysis showed that Metabase handles timezones through a hierarchy of settings:
     - Report timezone (if configured and supported by the driver)
     - Database timezone (from sync metadata)
     - System timezone (JVM default)

     Date/time values are formatted with the appropriate timezone during result processing, and timezone information is included in query result
  metadata.

⏺ Based on the information gathered, here's how Metabase handles database connection pooling:

  Metabase uses C3P0 as its connection pooling solution for both the application database and data warehouse databases. The implementation is
  split between several key modules:

  1. External library dependency:
    - Metabase uses a custom library called metabase/connection-pool (version 1.2.0) defined in deps.edn, which provides a wrapper around C3P0.
    - It also directly depends on com.mchange/c3p0 (version 0.10.1).
  2. Application Database Connection Pool:
    - The setup is handled in src/metabase/db/connection_pool_setup.clj
    - It creates a connection pool for the application database (the database that stores Metabase metadata, users, dashboards, etc.)
    - The pool is configured with sensible defaults like automatic connection testing and idle connection timeouts
    - Includes a DbActivityTracker that monitors connection activity for health checking
  3. Data Warehouse Connection Pools:
    - For external databases that Metabase connects to (data warehouses), pool management is in src/metabase/driver/sql_jdbc/connection.clj
    - Each database connection gets its own dedicated connection pool
    - Pools are cached in the database-id->connection-pool atom to avoid creating new pools unnecessarily
    - When database details change, the pool is automatically invalidated and recreated
  4. Pool Configuration:
    - For the application database, configuration is in application-db-connection-pool-props
    - For data warehouses, configuration is in data-warehouse-connection-pool-properties
    - Settings include max pool size, idle timeout, connection testing, and unreturned connection timeout
    - Environment variables and settings control pool sizes (e.g., MB_APPLICATION_DB_MAX_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE)
  5. Key Features:
    - Connection validation through testConnectionOnCheckout
    - Automatic detection and reset of stale or broken connections
    - SSH tunnel integration for remote databases
    - Monitoring via activity tracking (timestamps of recent connections)
    - Password and auth management, including Azure managed identity support
  6. Default Pool Sizes:
    - Data warehouse max pool size defaults to 15 (configurable via settings)
    - Application DB pool size is configurable via environment variables
  7. Security Features:
    - Unreturned connection timeouts prevent pool exhaustion if code doesn't properly close connections
    - Optional debug stack traces for tracking unreturned connections
    - Password expiration and renewal handling

  The code uses a thread-safe approach to pool management, ensuring that only one pool exists per database and that old pools are properly
  destroyed when configurations change or connections break.

⏺ Search(pattern: "PDF_EXPORT", path: "frontend/src/metabase/dashboard/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx")…

  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Task(I need to find the specific implementation for how dashboard cards are rendered in PDF exports in Metabase. I've already found the       …
      save-dashboard-pdf.ts file, which handles the process of creating the PDF. Now I need to find how the dashboard content is prepared for PDF
      export. Specifically, look for code that deals with the DASHBOARD_PDF_EXPORT_ROOT_ID in the Dashboard.tsx component or any other relevant
      code. Please search for any implementation details related to PDF export of dashboard cards in the Metabase codebase.)

  ⎿  Done (6 tool uses · 42.7k tokens · 32.1s)


⏺ The process for rendering dashboard cards in PDF exports in Metabase involves several key components:

  1. Initiating the Export:
    - When a user clicks the "Export as PDF" button, the export process is triggered from either ExportAsPdfButton.tsx or ExportPdfMenuItem.tsx
    - Both components call the saveDashboardPdf function with the dashboard's name and a selector for the content to export
  2. Selecting Content:
    - The main dashboard content is contained in an element with the ID DASHBOARD_PDF_EXPORT_ROOT_ID ("Dashboard-Parameters-And-Cards-Container")
    - This element contains both the dashboard parameters and all dashboard cards
  3. Rendering to Image:
    - Metabase uses the html2canvas-pro library to capture the dashboard DOM as an image
    - Special CSS is applied during capture to ensure proper styling (defined in save-chart-image.ts)
    - The library handles converting DOM elements to a canvas including charts, tables, and other visualizations
  4. Smart Pagination:
    - For multi-page dashboards, Metabase uses an intelligent algorithm to determine optimal page breaks
    - The findPageBreakCandidates and getPageBreaks functions identify good places to split content between pages
    - Table cards allow for page breaks between rows via the data-allow-page-break-after attribute
  5. PDF Generation:
    - The jspdf library converts the captured images into a PDF document
    - Headers are added to each page with the dashboard name
    - Dashboard parameters are included at the top of the first page
    - Page breaks are applied while maintaining readability and preventing cards from being split awkwardly
  6. Special Handling for Large Content:
    - For dashboards that span multiple pages, the algorithm ensures:
        - Dashboard cards aren't split across pages unless specifically allowed (like tables)
      - Pages maintain reasonable aspect ratios appropriate for PDF viewing
      - The last page is properly sized to prevent horizontal trimming

  The entire process happens client-side in the browser, with no server-side rendering involved. The PDF generation leverages modern browser
  capabilities to capture the rendered dashboard exactly as it appears on screen, maintaining styling, charts, and layout.

      definitions like "enable-query-caching", "query-caching-max-kb", and "query-caching-max-ttl". Find all the relevant settings that control
      how query caching works in Metabase.)

  ⎿  Done (3 tool uses · 40.9k tokens · 21.1s)


⏺ Based on my research, here's how Metabase implements caching for query results:

  Core Components and Settings

  1. Configuration Settings:
    - enable-query-caching: Toggle to enable/disable query caching entirely (default: true)
    - query-caching-max-kb: Maximum size of cached results per query in KB (default: 2000KB/2MB)
    - query-caching-max-ttl: Maximum time to keep cached results in seconds (default: 35 days)
  2. Database Storage:
    - Metabase stores query results in the query_cache table in the application database
    - The query cache is identified by a hash of the normalized query
    - Results are serialized, compressed, and optionally encrypted before storage
  3. Cache Backend:
    - The default backend is :db (application database)
    - Implemented in metabase.query-processor.middleware.cache-backend.db
    - The backend can be configured via the MB_QP_CACHE_BACKEND environment variable

  Caching Process

  1. Cache Eligibility:
    - Caching is opt-in through a :cache-strategy in the query
    - The strategy determines cache TTL and invalidation rules
    - Only queries that ran longer than a specified duration are cached
    - Results must be smaller than query-caching-max-kb when serialized
  2. Serialization Process:
    - Uses the nippy library for efficient binary serialization
    - Applies GZIP compression to reduce storage size
    - Has a structured format: [initial-metadata row-1 row-2 ... row-n final-metadata]
    - Encrypts data if database encryption is enabled
  3. Cache Retrieval:
    - Before running a query, Metabase checks for a valid cache entry
    - If found, validates the cache version matches current format
    - For valid cache hits, streams results without executing the query
    - Attaches metadata to indicate the results came from cache
  4. Cache Invalidation:
    - TTL-based expiration based on query strategy
    - For queries with a TTL strategy, TTL is calculated based on execution time
    - Automatic purging of old entries beyond query-caching-max-ttl
    - Enterprise version offers more invalidation strategies
  5. Maintenance:
    - Background task purges outdated cache entries
    - Includes safeguards against excessive memory usage during serialization
    - Error handling to prevent cache-related issues from affecting query execution

  The implementation is highly optimized with features like:
  - Efficient binary streaming of results
  - Parallel processing via the BatchTool
  - Intelligent handling of large result sets
  - Support for different backends in enterprise versions

  The caching system is primarily client-side (browser-to-Metabase), handled entirely in the query processor middleware stack, and operates
  transparently to both users and connected databases.

    - JWT authentication is an enterprise feature in Metabase
    - Configuration settings include JWT shared secret, identity provider URI, and attribute mappings
    - Users can configure JWT through the Admin Settings UI or environment variables
    - Key settings include jwt-shared-secret, jwt-identity-provider-uri, and attribute mappings
  2. Authentication Process:
    - When a user attempts to access a protected resource without being logged in, they are redirected to /auth/sso
    - The request retains the original URL in the return_to parameter
    - The user is redirected to the Identity Provider's login page configured in jwt-identity-provider-uri
    - After successful authentication at the IdP, the IdP generates a JWT token
    - The IdP sends the user back to Metabase with this token: /auth/sso?jwt=TOKEN&return_to=ORIGINAL_URL
  3. Token Validation and Processing:
    - Metabase receives the JWT token and verifies it using the shared secret
    - Token validation includes checking the signature and expiration (3-minute validity window)
    - From the token payload, Metabase extracts user information using configured attribute mappings:
        - Email address (default key: "email")
      - First name (default key: "first_name")
      - Last name (default key: "last_name")
      - Groups (default key: "groups") if group sync is enabled
  4. User Creation/Retrieval:
    - If JWT user provisioning is enabled, Metabase creates new user accounts automatically
    - For existing users, Metabase updates login attributes from the JWT
    - Users created via JWT are flagged with sso_source: "jwt" to track their authentication method
  5. Group Synchronization:
    - If group synchronization is enabled, Metabase updates the user's group memberships
    - Admin can configure mappings between JWT groups and Metabase groups
    - Group mappings are stored as JSON with JWT group names as keys and arrays of Metabase group IDs as values
    - Only mapped groups are synchronized; existing memberships in non-mapped groups are preserved
  6. Session Creation:
    - After successful authentication, Metabase creates a session for the user
    - The session is stored in the database and returned as cookies
    - The user is redirected to their original destination URL

  Security Features

  1. Token Security:
    - JWT tokens are signed using the shared secret
    - Tokens have a 3-minute validity window
    - Support for standard JWT claims (iss, sub, aud, exp, etc.)
    - Login attributes are extracted from the token but standard claims are filtered out
  2. User Account Management:
    - Users authenticated via JWT cannot use password login by default
    - Password login can be completely disabled for all users via settings
    - JWT authentication can be enabled/disabled globally
  3. Embedding Applications:
    - When using the Embedding SDK, JWT can be used for authenticating embedded dashboards
    - Supports stateless authentication for embedded applications

  The entire JWT integration is part of Metabase's enterprise SSO features, which makes it suitable for organizations that need to integrate with
   identity providers like Auth0, Microsoft Azure AD, or custom JWT providers.

⏺ Based on my research into Metabase's codebase, here's how database permissions are enforced in the query processor:

  Core Permission Enforcement Architecture

  1. Permission Middleware
    - Permissions are enforced through middleware in the query processor pipeline
    - The primary enforcement happens in metabase.query-processor.middleware.permissions
    - This middleware runs early in the query processing flow to validate permissions before query execution
  2. Permission Calculation
    - The system identifies all database resources (tables/schemas) referenced in a query
    - Different permission requirements are calculated for:
        - Native (SQL) queries: Require full database native access permissions
      - MBQL queries: Require permissions for each referenced table
      - Nested queries: Recursively check permissions for all source queries
  3. Permission Types
    - Two main permission types are checked:
        - perms/view-data: Ability to view/read data from tables
      - perms/create-queries: Ability to create queries (query-builder or native)
    - Permissions can be granted at table level or database level

  Specific Permission Checks

  1. For Ad-hoc Queries
    - Extracts all source tables via query->source-table-ids
    - Checks if the current user has appropriate permissions for each table
    - For native queries, checks for full native query access to the database
  2. For Card-based Queries
    - When a query uses a saved question (Card) as a source:
        - Checks if the user has read access to the Card's collection
      - Doesn't require database access if the user has Card access
      - Recursively checks permissions for any nested Cards
  3. For Sandboxed Users
    - Enterprise Edition adds data sandboxing (row-level restrictions)
    - gtap-perms (Group Table Access Policies) modify effective permissions
    - These permissions are stored in special ::perms key in the query
    - The middleware strips these keys to prevent user manipulation
  4. Inactive Tables
    - Special validation prevents queries against inactive tables
    - This check happens before permission checks
    - Shows different error messages based on user's permissions

  Security Protections

  1. Query Manipulation Protection
    - Filters out any user-supplied ::perms keys from queries
    - Removes :qp/stage-is-from-source-card keys from user queries
    - Prevents users from bypassing security by manipulating query structures
    - Blocks users from claiming a native query was compiled from MBQL
  2. Query Permissions Middleware
    - Runs for all queries except public/embedded queries
    - Throws permission exceptions when access is denied
    - Provides detailed error information with required permissions
  3. Embedding/Public Sharing
    - For public/embedded dashboards, permissions are checked at creation time
    - Embedded queries have different permission validation paths
    - JWT authentication can provide temporary access to specific resources

  The overall approach is comprehensive, layered, and handles various edge cases like nested queries, sandboxing, and source cards. The system
  balances security with flexibility by checking permissions at the most appropriate level (collection permissions for saved questions vs. data
  permissions for ad-hoc queries).

⏺ Based on my research, here's a comprehensive explanation of how data sandboxing is implemented in Metabase:

  Core Concept

  Data sandboxing in Metabase is an enterprise feature that allows for row-level and column-level security, enabling different users to see
  different subsets of data from the same tables. Sandboxes are implemented through "Group Table Access Policies" (GTAPs) - rules that determine
  what data members of specific groups can access.

  Key Components of the Implementation

  1. Data Model: Group Table Access Policies
    - Stored in the sandboxes table in Metabase's application database
    - Each GTAP connects a permissions group to a table with filtering rules
    - Can be based on either attribute filtering or custom SQL queries
  2. Types of Sandboxing:
    - Basic Sandboxing (Row-Level): Filters table rows based on user attributes
    - Custom Sandboxing (Row and Column-Level): Uses a saved SQL question as a replacement for the table, allowing both row and column
  restrictions
  3. User Attribute Mapping:
    - Each user has "login attributes" stored in their profile
    - Sandboxes map these attributes to parameters in filters or SQL queries
    - This enables dynamic filtering where each user sees only their data

  Implementation Flow in the Query Processor

  1. Permission Detection:
    - When a user runs a query, the middleware checks if they belong to groups with sandboxed tables
    - The enforce-sandbox? function determines if a sandbox should be applied for a user
    - If the user has unrestricted access via another group, sandboxing is bypassed
  2. Query Transformation:
    - The apply-sandboxing middleware detects tables referenced in the query
    - For each table that needs sandboxing, it identifies the appropriate GTAP
    - It then transforms the query by replacing references to original tables with either:
        - A filtered version of the table (basic sandboxing)
      - A subquery using a saved SQL question (custom sandboxing)
  3. Parameter Substitution:
    - For attribute-based sandboxes, user attribute values are inserted into query filters
    - For custom sandboxes, user attribute values are passed as parameters to the underlying SQL queries
    - This ensures users only see rows that match their attributes
  4. Recursive Processing:
    - The system handles nested queries by recursively applying sandboxing transformations
    - Limited to 20 levels of recursion to prevent infinite loops
  5. Metadata Management:
    - Carefully preserves column metadata to ensure query results appear identical to unsandboxed queries
    - Handles column type checking to ensure sandboxes return compatible data types

  Security Enforcement

  1. Sandboxes Override:
    - Sandboxing is applied as a middleware in the query processor pipeline
    - When activated, it tracks granted permissions and augments the query processing context
    - Adds ::perms keys to queries to pass sandbox information through the pipeline
  2. Conflict Resolution:
    - System detects and prevents multiple sandboxes for the same table/user combination
    - Ensures one group can't bypass another group's restrictions
  3. Protection from SQL Bypass:
    - Native SQL queries don't honor sandboxes (they go directly to the database)
    - System prevents sandbox bypass by:
        - Revoking "Native" query permissions for sandboxed users
      - Collection permissions to restrict access to saved SQL questions that could reveal restricted data

  Technical Implementation Details

  1. Caching:
    - The system caches sandbox calculations for performance
    - Uses the qp.store/cached mechanism to avoid recalculating sandboxes within a request
  2. Query Result Processing:
    - Post-processes query results to merge metadata from original tables
    - Adds an is_sandboxed flag to result metadata for tracking
  3. Performance Optimizations:
    - Uses efficient query transforms rather than running additional queries
    - Caches metadata for tables to avoid repeated preprocessing
  4. Data Type Safety:
    - Validates that column types in sandboxed results match the original table
    - Ensures proper type conversion for user attribute values (string to numeric when needed)

  The implementation is designed to be both secure and performant, with careful attention to maintaining the expected behavior of Metabase
  features while enforcing data restrictions. The system integrates deeply with Metabase's permissions framework while adding the specialized
  capabilities needed for row and column-level security.

  6. Current Work:
     The most recent work was analyzing how Metabase handles timezone conversions for queries. I explored relevant files including:
     - `/src/metabase/query_processor/timezone.clj`: Defines the core timezone logic
     - `/src/metabase/query_processor/middleware/add_timezone_info.clj`: Adds timezone metadata to query results

     - `/docs/configuring-metabase/timezones.md` and `/docs/troubleshooting-guide/timezones.md`: Documentation on timezone configuration

     The analysis showed that Metabase handles timezones through a hierarchy of settings:
     - Report timezone (if configured and supported by the driver)
     - Database timezone (from sync metadata)
     - System timezone (JVM default)

     Date/time values are formatted with the appropriate timezone during result processing, and timezone information is included in query result
  metadata.

⏺ Based on my research into how Metabase handles timezone conversions for queries, here's a comprehensive explanation:

  Timezone Resolution Hierarchy

  Metabase implements a hierarchical approach to timezone handling in queries:

  1. Report Timezone: If configured and supported by the database driver
  2. Database Timezone: If discovered during database sync
  3. System Timezone: The JVM's timezone as a fallback

  Core Components

  The timezone handling system consists of several key components:

  1. Timezone Identification (timezone.clj):
    - Determines which timezone to use for a query through functions like results-timezone-id
    - Provides report-timezone-id-if-supported to check driver support
    - Includes fallback mechanisms to ensure a valid timezone is always used
  2. Metadata Enrichment (add_timezone_info.clj):
    - Attaches timezone information to query results
    - Adds both the requested timezone (requested_timezone) and actual results timezone (results_timezone) to metadata
  3. Value Formatting (format_rows.clj):
    - Converts date/time values to ISO-8601 strings in the appropriate timezone
    - Implements specific formatting rules for different date/time types (LocalDate, ZonedDateTime, etc.)
    - Handles special cases like the convert-timezone function
  4. Relative Datetime Calculation (relative_datetime.clj):
    - Computes relative dates (like "today", "last month") in the correct timezone
    - Uses qp.timezone/now to ensure consistent timezone handling

  Database Driver Support

  The key feature flag that enables timezone setting is :set-timezone, which indicates whether a driver supports setting a query timezone. Each
  database driver implements this differently:

  - PostgreSQL: Uses SET TIME ZONE statements
  - MySQL: Sets session variables
  - Snowflake: Uses ALTER SESSION commands
  - BigQuery: Applies timezone in query parameters
  - MongoDB: Handles timezone conversion at the application level

  Some databases don't support changing the timezone at query time, in which case Metabase converts the results after retrieval.

  Timezone Configuration

  Users can configure timezones at several levels:

  1. Report Timezone: In Admin Settings > Localization
  2. Database Timezone: Discovered during database sync
  3. JVM Timezone: Set via -Duser.timezone or JAVA_TIMEZONE environment variable

  Common Challenges

  1. Timestamp Types: Results depend on whether fields are stored as:
    - timestamp with time zone (aware of location)
    - timestamp with offset (knows offset from UTC)
    - timestamp without time zone (no timezone information)
  2. SQL Query Limitations: The report timezone setting doesn't affect native SQL queries, requiring manual timezone specifications.
  3. Mixed Timezone Data: Comparing dates with different or missing timezone information leads to inconsistent results.

  This architecture ensures Metabase can handle timezone conversions consistently across various database types while giving users the
  flexibility to view data in their preferred timezone.

⏺ The process for scheduling and sending dashboard subscriptions in Metabase involves several interconnected components:

  Subscription Setup and Storage

  1. Creating Subscriptions: Users configure subscriptions through the frontend UI (DashboardSubscriptionsSidebar.jsx), where they:
    - Select cards from the dashboard to include
    - Choose delivery channels (email or Slack)
    - Set schedule preferences (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
    - Specify recipients
  2. Storage Model: Subscriptions are stored as "Pulses" in the database with:
    - pulse table - stores subscription metadata
    - pulse_card table - links cards to the subscription
    - pulse_channel table - defines delivery channels
    - pulse_channel_recipient table - lists recipients

  Scheduling System

  1. Quartz Scheduler: Metabase uses the Java Quartz scheduler for timing:
    - When Metabase starts, init-dashboard-subscription-triggers! in send_pulses.clj sets up triggers for all active subscriptions
    - Each subscription creates a CronTrigger with its schedule
  2. Trigger Management:
    - update-send-pulse-trigger-if-needed! updates triggers when subscriptions change
    - Subscriptions with the same schedule are grouped to run together for efficiency
    - The scheduler respects timezone configuration from user settings

  Execution Process

  When a scheduled subscription is triggered:

  1. Pulse Retrieval: send-pulse!* function:
    - Retrieves the pulse (subscription) data
    - Filters channels to determine which to send now
    - Checks for and removes empty channels
  2. Content Generation: For each card in the subscription:
    - The query is executed to get fresh data
    - Results are processed based on the visualization type
    - Different renderers format the content for different visualization types:
        - Tables are formatted with HTML
      - Charts are rendered as PNG images
      - Numbers are formatted according to settings
  3. Rendering: The channel/render modules:
    - body.clj - Handles overall structure and content
    - png.clj - Renders visualizations as images using CSSBox
    - table.clj - Formats tabular data
  4. Delivery: The send-notification! function:
    - Determines channel types (email/Slack)
    - For emails:
        - Creates HTML email with embedded images
      - Attaches CSV/Excel files if requested
      - Sends to all recipients
    - For Slack:
        - Formats messages with attachments
      - Posts to configured Slack channels
  5. Retry Logic: Built-in error handling:
    - Failed deliveries are retried based on configurable retry policy
    - Errors are logged and tracked
    - Task history records successes and failures

  Notable Features

  1. Async Delivery: Notifications can be sent asynchronously via a thread pool
  2. Timezone Awareness: Scheduling respects report timezones
  3. Error Handling: Robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  4. Conditional Delivery: "Skip if empty" option prevents sending when there's no data
  5. Format Options: Support for various formats (HTML tables, images, CSV/Excel attachments)

  This architecture ensures that dashboard subscriptions are reliably delivered according to schedule, with appropriate content formatting for
  different channels and visualization types.

⏺ Metabase implements custom expressions in the query builder through a sophisticated architecture that spans both frontend and backend
  components. Here's a comprehensive explanation of how it works:

  Frontend Implementation

  1. Expression Editor

  The primary user interface for creating expressions is the ExpressionWidget component, which provides:

  - A CodeMirror-based text editor with syntax highlighting and autocompletion
  - Real-time validation and error reporting
  - Support for various expression types (math, string operations, conditionals)
  - Function browser for discovering available functions
  - Visual feedback for syntax and type errors

  The core components include:
  - ExpressionWidget.tsx - The main container component
  - Editor.tsx - Handles text editing and syntax highlighting
  - FunctionBrowser - Shows available functions with documentation

  2. Expression Parsing and Validation

  Expressions go through several processing steps on the frontend:

  1. Lexical Analysis: The lexify function tokenizes the expression string into tokens
  2. Parsing: The parse function converts tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
  3. Validation: The diagnoseExpression function performs multiple validation checks:
    - Syntax correctness (matching parentheses, commas in argument lists)
    - Type compatibility between operands
    - Function existence and argument counts
    - Preventing illegal operations (like nested aggregations)
    - Detecting circular references
  4. Compilation: The compileExpression function converts the validated expression into an MBQL clause

  3. Expression State Management

  Expressions are stored in the query's state as part of the MBQL query structure:

  {
    "expressions": {
      "Profit": ["- ", ["field", 39, null], ["field", 41, null]]
    }
  }

  When users edit expressions:
  1. The frontend creates an abstract syntax tree from the text input
  2. It validates the expression for correctness
  3. Upon successful validation, it converts the expression to an MBQL clause
  4. This clause is stored in the query's expressions object with the given name

  Backend Implementation

  1. Expression Schema and Type System

  Metabase's backend implements a robust expression system defined in:
  - metabase.lib.schema.expression - Defines expression schemas
  - metabase.lib.expression - Implements expression operations

  The type system ensures expressions are well-formed and provides:
  - Type inference for expressions (type-of function)
  - Type checking and validation
  - Conversion between different data types

  2. Expression Functions and Operators

  The backend supports a wide range of expression operations defined as multi-methods:

  (lib.common/defop + [x y & more])
  (lib.common/defop - [x y & more])
  (lib.common/defop * [x y & more])
  (lib.common/defop / [x y & more])

  These include:
  - Mathematical operators (+, -, *, /)
  - Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, CASE)
  - Text functions (CONCAT, SUBSTRING, REPLACE)
  - Date/time functions (DATEADD, DATEDIFF)
  - Aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
  - Type conversion functions

  3. Translation to Native Queries

  When Metabase executes a query containing expressions:

  1. The query processor parses the MBQL query with its expressions
  2. It resolves all expression references to their actual expressions
  3. It translates expressions into the appropriate native SQL (or other database language)
  4. The translation is database-specific, with each database driver implementing its own translation logic

  For example, an expression like [+ [field 1] [field 2]] might be translated to SQL as "table"."field1" + "table"."field2".

  Expression Types and Capabilities

  Metabase supports several types of expressions:

  1. Column Expressions: Creating new columns from existing ones
  [Price] * [Quantity]
  2. Aggregation Expressions: Creating aggregations with expressions
  Sum([Price] * [Quantity])
  3. Filter Expressions: Complex filtering conditions
  case([Total] > 100, "High", "Low")
  4. Custom Aggregation Expressions: Combining aggregations
  Sum([Revenue]) / Count(distinct [Customer ID])
  5. Window Functions: Expressions involving partitioning and ordering
  window(sum([Total]), [Category])

  Integration with Query Building

  Expressions are fully integrated with the query builder:
  - They can be added as new columns in the result set
  - They can be used in filters and group-by clauses
  - They can be used in custom aggregations
  - Their results are properly typed and formatted in the UI
  - They can reference other expressions (with safeguards against circular references)

  This architecture provides a powerful yet user-friendly interface for creating complex expressions that translate into efficient database
  queries across Metabase's supported database engines.

⏺ Metabase's database driver plugin system is a sophisticated architecture that dynamically loads and initializes database drivers at runtime.
  Here's a comprehensive explanation of how it works:

  Discovery and Loading Process

  1. Plugin Directory
    - Metabase looks for plugins in the plugins directory (configurable via MB_PLUGINS_DIR)
    - If the directory doesn't exist, it's created automatically
    - System modules are extracted from the Metabase JAR's resources/modules directory
  2. Plugin Identification
    - During startup, Metabase scans the plugins directory for JAR files
    - Each JAR is examined for a metabase-plugin.yaml manifest
    - This manifest contains metadata about the plugin, including driver name, parent drivers, and initialization steps
  3. Loading Strategy
    - Most drivers use "lazy loading" to minimize startup time and memory usage
    - Only minimal driver information is loaded initially
    - Full driver code is loaded on first use

  Initialization Process

  1. Plugin Registration
    - For each discovered plugin JAR with a manifest:
        - The plugin info is parsed from the manifest
      - Basic driver metadata (name, display name, connection properties) is registered
      - For lazy-loaded drivers, a placeholder driver is registered
  2. Lazy Loading Mechanism
    - When a driver method is first called, the the-initialized-driver function is triggered
    - This function ensures the driver is fully loaded before use
    - Loading happens only once per driver, with the loaded state tracked in an atom
  3. Initialization Steps
    - The manifest file specifies initialization steps to perform:
        - load-namespace: Loads the main driver namespace
      - register-jdbc-driver: Registers the JDBC driver class with Java
    - Custom initialization steps can be defined for specific drivers
  4. Dependency Management
    - Plugins can declare dependencies on:
        - Java classes (e.g., JDBC drivers)
      - Other Metabase plugins
      - Environment variables
    - Plugins with unsatisfied dependencies are queued
    - As dependencies are satisfied, dependent plugins are initialized

  ClassLoader Architecture

  1. Dynamic ClassLoader
    - Metabase uses a custom DynamicClassLoader to add JARs to the classpath at runtime
    - This allows loading JAR files that weren't present at application startup
    - The classloader is thread-local to prevent conflicts
  2. Plugin JAR Loading
    - When a driver is initialized, its JAR file is added to the classpath
    - Additional dependencies specified in the manifest are also loaded

  Driver Hierarchy and Extension

  1. Parent-Child Relationships
    - Drivers form a hierarchy using Clojure's derivation system
    - Common drivers like :sql and :sql-jdbc serve as abstract parent drivers
    - Child drivers inherit functionality from parents but can override specific methods
  2. Multimethods
    - Driver functionality is implemented via Clojure's multimethod system
    - Methods dispatch on the driver keyword (e.g., :postgres, :mysql)
    - The hierarchy allows fallback to parent implementations
  3. Concrete vs. Abstract Drivers
    - Abstract drivers provide shared functionality but can't be used directly
    - Concrete drivers are fully functional and available in the UI
    - This distinction is tracked in the driver hierarchy

  Safety and Error Handling

  1. Thread Safety
    - The system uses read-write locks to prevent race conditions during driver loading
    - Multiple threads can use the same driver concurrently once loaded
  2. Dependency Resolution
    - Circular dependencies are detected and prevented
    - If a dependency can't be satisfied, informative error messages are provided
  3. Error Recovery
    - If a driver fails to load, it won't prevent other drivers from loading
    - Detailed error information is logged for troubleshooting

  Driver Plugin Manifest

  The metabase-plugin.yaml manifest is crucial and contains:

  info:
    name: driver-name
    version: 1.0.0
  driver:
    name: driver-name
    display-name: "User-friendly Display Name"
    parent: [sql-jdbc]
    lazy-load: true
    connection-properties:
      - host
      - merge:
          - port
          - placeholder: 5432
  init:
    - step: load-namespace
      namespace: metabase.driver.driver-name
    - step: register-jdbc-driver
      class: org.example.Driver

  This architecture allows Metabase to support a wide variety of database drivers while maintaining a clean, extensible codebase and minimizing
  startup overhead by only loading drivers when they're actually needed.

⏺ Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a comprehensive explanation of Metabase's audit system for tracking user actions:

  Core Architecture

  Metabase implements a robust audit system that tracks user actions through a centralized event-driven architecture. The system consists of:

  1. Audit Log Table (audit_log): The primary storage for audit events, with columns:
    - id: Unique identifier
    - topic: The event type (like card-create, user-login)
    - timestamp: When the event occurred
    - user_id: Who performed the action
    - model and model_id: What was affected (e.g., "Card" and its ID)
    - details: JSON blob with additional context
  2. Event System: The mechanism for capturing and publishing events:
    - Events are published via events/publish-event! with a topic and payload
    - Topics follow a hierarchical structure using Clojure's derivation system
    - Event handlers transform events into audit log entries

  Event Capture Process

  When a user performs an action:

  1. Action Trigger: Code in the relevant part of the application calls events/publish-event!
  (events/publish-event! :event/dashboard-create {:object dashboard :user-id user-id})
  2. Event Dispatch: The event system dispatches to handlers based on the topic hierarchy
  (derive ::dashboard-event ::event)
  (derive :event/dashboard-create ::dashboard-event)

  (methodical/defmethod events/publish-event! ::dashboard-event
    [topic event]
    (audit-log/record-event! topic event))
  3. Audit Recording: The record-event! function processes and stores the event
  (defn record-event! [topic params]
    (when (premium-features/log-enabled?)
      ;; Create structured event data
      (let [{:keys [user-id model-name model-id details]} (construct-event topic params)]
        ;; Insert into database
        (t2/insert! :model/AuditLog
                  :topic    topic
                  :details  details
                  :model    model-name
                  :model_id model-id
                  :user_id  user-id))))
  4. Data Transformation: The construct-event function transforms raw event data into a standardized format
    - Extracts relevant fields from the object
    - For updates, computes diffs between old and new values
    - Adds contextual information

  Tracked Events

  The system tracks numerous event types, including:

  1. User-related: Login, creation, updates, deactivation, password resets
  2. Content-related:
    - Card/question operations (create, update, delete, view)
    - Dashboard operations (create, update, delete, add cards, remove cards)
    - Collection operations
  3. Database-related: Creation, updates, syncs, scans
  4. Security-related: Permission failures, setting changes, API key operations
  5. Administrative: Installation events, user onboarding
  6. Operational: Pulse/subscription events, uploads, cache configuration

  Enterprise Edition Enhancements

  The Enterprise Edition extends the core audit capabilities with:

  1. Audit App: A specialized application for analyzing audit data
    - Custom dashboards with pre-built analytics
    - Internal database connection (ID 13371337) for audit queries
    - Custom SQL queries optimized for different database engines
  2. Enriched Queries: Specialized middleware for audit queries
    - handle_audit_queries.clj processes audit-specific internal queries
    - Custom query functions for different audit views
    - Support for both legacy and reducible result formats
  3. Performance Optimizations:
    - Database views for efficient querying
    - Pagination support for large result sets
    - Optimized SQL for different database backends

  Security and Access Controls

  The audit system implements several security measures:

  1. Premium Feature Gate: Full audit functionality is part of the Premium/Enterprise edition
    - Base functionality checks (premium-features/log-enabled?)
    - Enhanced audit APIs are in the Enterprise namespace
  2. Access Restrictions:
    - Audit data is only accessible to administrators
    - API endpoints require authentication and authorization
    - Enterprise audit data requires superuser permissions
  3. Data Protection:
    - Sensitive data is filtered from audit logs
    - API keys and credentials are never logged
    - Schema validation ensures consistent data format

  API and Data Access

  The audit data can be accessed through:

  1. API Endpoints: Enterprise Edition provides specialized endpoints:
    - /api/ee/audit-app/ for accessing audit data
    - User-specific audit info at /api/ee/audit-app/user/audit-info
    - Dashboard and question usage analytics
  2. Direct Queries: Administrators can query the audit data using Metabase itself:
    - The audit app creates specialized questions and dashboards
    - Queries are optimized using database-specific syntax

  The audit system provides a complete, searchable history of actions in Metabase, enabling administrators to track usage, monitor security,
  troubleshoot issues, and understand user behavior patterns.

⏺ Based on my examination of the Metabase codebase, here's a comprehensive explanation of how parameter passing works in embedded dashboards:

  Parameter Architecture in Embedded Dashboards

  Metabase's embedded dashboards support a sophisticated parameter system that enables filtering and customization while maintaining security.
  The parameter system operates through multiple layers:

  1. Parameter Definition and Storage

  Parameters in dashboards are stored in two key database fields:
  - parameters: An array of all dashboard parameters, each with properties like id, name, slug, type, and other metadata
  - embedding_params: A map that controls how each parameter can be used in embedding, with three possible values:
    - "disabled": Parameter cannot be specified in either token or URL
    - "enabled": Parameter can be specified in either JWT token or URL, but not both
    - "locked": Parameter must be specified in the JWT token only

  2. Parameter Passing Mechanisms

  Embedded dashboards support two methods of passing parameters:

  JWT Token Parameters (Secure Method)

  - Parameters are encoded and signed with the embedding secret key in a JWT token
  - Generated server-side using functions like getSignedToken()
  - Example JWT structure:
  {
    "resource": { "dashboard": 42 },
    "params": { "category": "Gadgets", "date": "2023-01-01" },
    "iat": 1679123456
  }
  - Used for security-sensitive parameters and "locked" parameters
  - Cannot be tampered with by end users

  URL Query Parameters (User-Controllable)

  - Parameters appended to the embedding URL as query string parameters
  - Example: https://metabase.example.com/embed/dashboard/TOKEN?category=Gadgets&date=2023-01-01
  - Used for "enabled" parameters that users should be able to change
  - Users can modify these values in the URL

  3. Parameter Validation and Security

  A series of validation steps ensure the security of parameter passing:

  1. Authentication: The JWT token is verified to ensure it's valid and not expired
  2. Parameter Visibility Enforcement:
    - check-params-are-allowed: Ensures parameters adhere to visibility rules
    - Prevents usage of disabled parameters
    - Prevents URL specification of locked parameters
    - Prevents parameter duplication between token and URL
  3. Parameter Existence Checking:
    - check-params-exist: Ensures all specified parameters exist in the dashboard
    - Prevents injection of unknown parameters
  4. Value Validation:
    - Ensures parameter values are valid and non-blank
    - Formats values appropriately for the parameter type

  4. Parameter Processing Flow

  When an embedded dashboard is loaded:

  1. The server decodes and verifies the JWT token using unsign-and-translate-ids
  2. The server validates the embedding is enabled for the resource with check-embedding-enabled-for-dashboard
  3. URL parameters are parsed and normalized with parse-query-params and normalize-query-params
  4. Token parameters and URL parameters are merged with validate-and-merge-params
  5. Dashboard parameters are resolved from slugs to IDs using resolve-dashboard-parameters
  6. The processed parameters are applied to each dashcard query via process-query-for-dashcard

  5. Special Parameter Handling Features

  Metabase supports several advanced parameter features:

  Parameter Type-Specific Processing

  - Different parameter types (string, number, date, etc.) are handled appropriately
  - Operator parameters (contains, starts with, etc.) accept multiple values
  - Date parameters support relative date options and proper formatting

  Default Values

  - Default values can be specified as URL parameters
  - Syntax: ?parameter_name=default_value
  - Multiple default values: ?parameter_name=value1&parameter_name=value2

  Hidden Parameters

  - Parameters can be hidden from the UI but still filter the data
  - Syntax: #hide_parameters=param1,param2
  - Useful for pre-filtering data without cluttering the UI

  Parameter Substitution in Text

  - For locked parameters, values are substituted into dashboard text cards
  - Implemented in substitute-token-parameters-in-text

  6. Frontend Implementation

  The frontend handles parameters through:

  1. Parameter Definition: In the embedding dialog, each parameter's embedding behavior is configured
  2. Token Generation: Using getSignedToken() to create signed JWT tokens
  3. URL Parameter Handling: Using URL query parameters to pass values to filter widgets
  4. Parameter Widget Display: Showing or hiding filter widgets based on configuration
  5. Parameter Interaction: Allowing users to interact with "enabled" parameter widgets

  Practical Implementation Example

  For a dashboard with geographical filters:

  1. Define Parameters: Dashboard has country and city parameters
  2. Configure Embedding:
    - Set country as "locked" (restricted by token)
    - Set city as "enabled" (user can filter)
  3. Backend Implementation:
  // Server-side code
  const token = getSignedToken(
    "dashboard",
    dashboardId,
    { country: "USA" }, // Locked parameter
    secretKey
  );
  const embedUrl = `https://metabase.example.com/embed/dashboard/${token}`;
  4. Frontend Implementation:
  <!-- In your website HTML -->
  <iframe
    src="https://metabase.example.com/embed/dashboard/TOKEN?city=Chicago#theme=night"
    frameborder="0"
    width="800"
    height="600"
  ></iframe>
  5. User Experience:
    - Dashboard loads with country locked to "USA" (cannot be changed by user)
    - city filter widget appears showing "Chicago" (can be changed by user)
    - User can interact with the city filter to see different cities within USA
    - User cannot override the country filter to see data from other countries

  This architecture carefully balances security (through JWT-signed parameters) with flexibility (through URL parameters), enabling embedded
  dashboards to be customized for different audiences while maintaining data security.

⏺ Based on my comprehensive review of Metabase's code, here's a detailed explanation of how the database metadata synchronization process works:

  Database Metadata Synchronization in Metabase

  Core Components of the Sync Process

  Metabase's synchronization process consists of three main phases, each serving a distinct purpose:

  1. Metadata Sync

  This phase updates Metabase's internal models with the latest database structure, including:
  - Tables, fields, and their properties
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Database version and timezone information
  - Index information
  - Table privileges (if supported by the database)

  2. Analysis

  After the basic metadata is synchronized, Metabase performs deeper analysis:
  - Fingerprinting fields (gathering statistical information about values)
  - Classifying fields based on content (semantic types like Email, URL, etc.)
  - Classifying tables based on content and usage patterns

  3. Field Values Caching

  For fields used in filtering, Metabase caches distinct values:
  - Collects unique values for appropriate fields
  - Maintains these cached values for quick filter UI rendering
  - Updates the caches based on usage patterns and recency

  The Sync Process Flow

  Initial Sync When Adding a Database

  When a new database is connected to Metabase:

  1. Database Connection Setup
    - Connection details are validated before proceeding
    - Initial database metadata is stored
  2. Full Sync Pipeline
    - Metadata sync is triggered first
    - Analysis and field values syncs follow
    - initial_sync_status tracks completion

  Scheduled Syncs

  After initial setup, Metabase maintains the metadata through scheduled tasks:

  1. Scheduling
    - Each database has two scheduled tasks:
        - SyncAndAnalyzeDatabase: Handles metadata sync and analysis
      - UpdateFieldValues: Manages field values caching
    - Default schedules are randomized to distribute load:
        - Metadata sync defaults to hourly
      - Field values updates default to daily
    - Schedules can be customized per database
  2. Execution Process
    - Tasks are managed through a Quartz scheduler
    - Each database has its own trigger for both tasks
    - The system prevents concurrent syncs for the same database

  Metadata Sync in Detail

  The sync-metadata! function orchestrates the metadata sync process:

  1. Schema Retrieval
    - Uses database-specific drivers to fetch current schema information
    - Retrieves tables, fields, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes
  2. Diff Computation and Updates
    - Compares fetched metadata with existing records
    - Identifies new, changed, and deleted objects
    - Updates Metabase's internal representation accordingly
  3. Key Steps:
    - Syncs database version and timezone (sync-dbms-version!, sync-timezone!)
    - Updates table information (sync-tables!)
    - Updates field metadata (sync-fields!)
    - Syncs foreign key relationships (sync-fks!)
    - Updates index information if available (maybe-sync-indexes!)
    - Processes any Metabase-specific metadata (sync-metabase-metadata!)
    - Syncs table privileges if supported (sync-table-privileges!)
  4. Table-Specific Handling:
    - New tables are marked active
    - Missing tables are marked inactive (not deleted)
    - "Crufty" tables (migration tables, framework internals) are automatically hidden

  Analysis Process

  Analysis goes beyond basic schema information:

  1. Field Fingerprinting
    - Collects statistics on field contents (min/max values, distinct count, etc.)
    - Only re-fingerprints fields when necessary (new or changed types)
    - Uses versioning to track fingerprint status
  2. Type Classification
    - Examines field contents to infer semantic types
    - Enhances user experience by setting appropriate display and behavior
    - Examples: recognizing emails, URLs, zip codes, etc.
  3. Table Classification
    - Identifies table roles (entity tables vs. join tables)
    - Influences default visualization and query suggestions
  4. Optimization
    - Uses a selective approach, only analyzing what needs updating
    - Tracks field status with last_analyzed timestamps and fingerprint_version

  Field Values Caching

  For fields marked for filtering:

  1. Value Collection
    - Retrieves distinct values for appropriate fields
    - Handles different data types appropriately
    - Limits to reasonable numbers of values
  2. Usage-Based Updating
    - Tracks field usage in the last_used_at column
    - Prioritizes frequently used fields
    - Skips updating rarely used fields
  3. Storage and Access
    - Values are stored in the field_values table
    - Accessible quickly when building filter UIs

  Technical Implementation Details

  Sync Architecture

  1. Multimethods and Driver Abstraction
    - Uses Clojure multimethods to dispatch on database type
    - Allows database-specific behavior where needed
    - Common operations are defined in base drivers
  2. Transaction and Error Handling
    - Each step occurs in its own transaction for isolation
    - Errors in one component don't affect others
    - Failures are logged but don't prevent subsequent sync attempts
  3. Progress Reporting
    - Uses emoji progress bars in logs for visibility
    - Records detailed stats for each phase
    - Stores task history for troubleshooting
  4. Concurrency Control
    - Prevents duplicate sync operations
    - Uses DisallowConcurrentExecution annotation on Quartz jobs
    - Tracks in-flight operations with atoms

  Selective Sync Optimization

  To minimize database load and sync time:

  1. Diff-Based Updates
    - Only processes changed objects
    - Uses efficient diffing algorithms to compare schemas
  2. Fingerprint Versioning
    - Tracks which fields need updating using version numbers
    - Avoids unnecessary reprocessing
  3. Smart Field Values Updates
    - Skips inactive fields (not used in recent filters)
    - Prioritizes frequently used fields
  4. Adaptive Refingerprinting
    - If analysis runs quickly with no fingerprinting, triggers selective refingerprinting
    - Helps maintain data quality while minimizing overhead

  Customization Options

  Administrators can control sync behavior:

  1. Sync Schedules
    - Set per-database sync frequencies
    - Choose between sync/analyze or just sync
  2. Field Inclusion
    - Mark sensitive fields to skip field values caching
    - Control which tables are included in sync
  3. Manual Triggering
    - Force immediate sync via admin UI
    - Select between full or metadata-only syncs

  This comprehensive system ensures Metabase maintains an accurate representation of database structure while balancing performance concerns and
  adapting to changing data environments.

⏺ Based on my analysis of Metabase's codebase, here's a comprehensive explanation of how native query execution with variables works:

  Native Query Execution with Variables in Metabase

  Core Architecture

  Metabase employs a sophisticated system for handling variables in native queries that balances flexibility, security, and database
  compatibility. The implementation spans multiple layers:

  1. Template Parsing - Detecting and parsing variables in the query text
  2. Value Resolution - Determining the values to substitute
  3. Parameter Substitution - Converting variables to SQL safely
  4. Query Execution - Running the final substituted query

  Template Syntax and Parsing

  Variable Syntax Types

  Metabase supports two main types of variable syntax:

  1. Required Parameters: {{variable_name}}
    - Must have a value provided
    - Directly substituted into the query
  2. Optional Clauses: [[AND {{variable_name}}]]
    - Only included if the variable has a value
    - Entire clause is omitted if the variable has no value
    - Useful for conditional filters that shouldn't affect the query when not specified

  Parsing Process

  The parsing occurs in metabase.driver.common.parameters.parse:

  1. Tokenization:
    - Query text is tokenized into strings and special tokens
    - Tokens are identified using regex patterns that match {{...}} and [[...]] syntax
    - SQL comments are handled specially to avoid parsing variables inside them
  2. Token Hierarchy:
    - Required parameters are represented by Param objects
    - Optional clauses are represented by Optional objects containing nested tokens
    - The result is a structured representation of the query with variables identified

  Parameter Value Resolution

  Parameter values are resolved in metabase.driver.common.parameters.values:

  1. Value Sources:
    - Query parameters from the API request
    - Default values from template tags
    - Values from field filters
  2. Template Tag Definition:
    - Each query contains a :template-tags map with metadata about parameters
    - Tag types include :text, :number, :date, :dimension (field filter), :snippet, and :card
  3. Value Processing:
    - Values are typed and converted to appropriate formats
    - Date values are parsed into proper temporal objects
    - Lists of values are handled specially for IN clauses

  Parameter Substitution

  The actual substitution happens in metabase.driver.sql.parameters.substitute:

  1. Substitution Process:
    - Iterates through the parsed tokens
    - For string tokens, appends them directly to the result
    - For parameter tokens, calculates the appropriate SQL replacement
  2. Parameter Type Handling:
    - Each parameter type has specific substitution logic:
        - Text: Escaped and added as prepared statement parameter
      - Numbers: Formatted appropriately based on database dialect
      - Dates: Converted to SQL date literals or range expressions
      - Field Filters: Expanded to appropriate WHERE clauses
      - Snippets: Raw SQL snippets are inserted directly
      - Card References: Expanded to subqueries
  3. Optional Clause Handling:
    - For [[...]] syntax, checks if all contained parameters have values
    - Only includes the clause if all parameters are non-empty
    - This allows for dynamic WHERE clauses that only apply when parameters are provided

  Security Measures

  Metabase implements several security measures to prevent SQL injection:

  1. Prepared Statements:
    - Most values are passed as prepared statement parameters (?)
    - Actual values are sent separately from the SQL text
    - This is the primary defense against SQL injection
  2. Type-Specific Processing:
    - Each value type has dedicated handling to ensure proper escaping
    - Complex types (like dates) are handled with appropriate SQL functions
  3. HoneySQL Integration:
    - Uses HoneySQL for structured SQL generation
    - Ensures proper quoting and escaping of identifiers and literals
  4. Parameter Validation:
    - Validates parameter types and values before substitution
    - Rejects unexpected or malformed parameters

  Special Parameter Types

  Field Filters

  Field filters ({{field_name}}) are a powerful feature:

  1. Definition:
    - Link a parameter to a specific field in the database
    - Include metadata about the field's type and table
  2. Operator Support:
    - Support various comparison operators: =, !=, >, <, between, etc.
    - Generate appropriate SQL based on the operator and field type
  3. Multi-Value Handling:
    - Single values generate simple equality conditions
    - Multiple values generate IN (...) clauses
    - Date ranges generate BETWEEN expressions

  SQL Snippets

  SQL snippets allow reusing common SQL fragments:

  1. Storage:
    - Stored as separate objects in the database
    - Referenced by ID in the query
  2. Substitution:
    - Inserted directly into the query without escaping
    - Useful for complex SQL fragments that are reused across queries

  Referenced Card Queries

  Card references allow embedding results from other saved queries:

  1. Implementation:
    - References another saved query by ID
    - Expands to a subquery containing that query's SQL
  2. Execution:
    - Compiles the referenced query
    - Inserts it as a subquery in the appropriate location

  Database-Specific Adaptations

  Metabase handles database-specific SQL variations:

  1. Driver Extensibility:
    - Uses multimethods to dispatch on driver type
    - Allows customizing parameter handling per database
  2. SQL Dialects:
    - Adapts date formatting based on database requirements
    - Handles differences in function naming and syntax
  3. Feature Detection:
    - Checks if a driver supports native parameters via driver.u/supports?
    - Falls back to simpler substitution for unsupported databases

  Execution Process Flow

  The complete flow for executing a native query with variables:

  1. Query Preparation:
    - Parse the template tags and variables in the query
    - Collect parameter values from the request
  2. Parameter Processing:
    - Convert parameter values to appropriate types
    - Handle special types like dates and field filters
  3. Variable Substitution:
    - Replace variables with their SQL equivalents
    - Generate prepared statement parameters
  4. Query Execution:
    - Execute the modified SQL with prepared statement values
    - Process the results and return them
  5. Error Handling:
    - Validate parameters before substitution
    - Provide clear error messages for missing or invalid parameters

  Practical Example

  For a query like:
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE {{created_at}}
  [[AND total > {{min_total}}]]

  With parameters:
  {
    "created_at": {"type": "date/range", "value": "2023-01-01~2023-12-31"},
    "min_total": {"type": "number/=", "value": 100}
  }

  The substitution process would:

  1. Parse the query into tokens
  2. Resolve the parameter values
  3. Replace {{created_at}} with created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?
  4. Include the optional clause, replacing {{min_total}} with ?
  5. Generate the final query:
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?
  AND total > ?
  6. Execute with parameter values: ["2023-01-01", "2023-12-31", 100]

  This architecture provides a powerful yet secure way to incorporate user input into native SQL queries while preventing SQL injection and
  maintaining database compatibility.

  ## 4. Problem Solving:

  Throughout the conversation, the focus has been on understanding Metabase's architecture rather than solving specific problems. Each
  exploration has provided comprehensive insights into how particular features are implemented, including:

  - Understanding how C3P0 connection pooling is configured differently for application DB vs data warehouses
  - Detailing how dashboard cards are rendered to PDFs via DOM capture and pagination
  - Explaining query caching's middleware-based approach and serialization mechanisms
  - Clarifying how JWT tokens are validated and used for authentication
  - Detailing permission checking in the query processor
  - Explaining data sandboxing through Group Table Access Policies
  - Describing timezone handling across different levels of configuration
  - Outlining the dashboard subscription delivery process
  - Explaining custom expression parsing, validation, and execution
  - Detailing the plugin system for database drivers
  - Describing the metadata sync process and its components
  - Explaining parameter substitution in native queries
  - Detailing model persistence implementation

  These explorations provide a foundation for potential problem solving, but no specific problems were presented for resolution.

  ## 5. Pending Tasks:

  There are no explicit pending tasks assigned by the user. The conversation has been focused on understanding Metabase's internal
  implementations rather than requesting specific changes or solutions.

  ## 6. Current Work:

  The most recent work was examining the implementation of data model persistence in Metabase. Key aspects explored included:

  1. The architecture of model persistence, which allows materializing models (saved queries) into actual database tables
  2. The PersistedInfo model, which tracks metadata about persisted models
  3. The refresh task, which handles scheduled refreshing of persisted models
  4. Settings management for controlling persistence behavior
  5. The process flow for creating, refreshing, and accessing persisted models

  Key files examined included:
  - `/src/metabase/model_persistence/models/persisted_info.clj` (model definition and lifecycle)
  - `/src/metabase/model_persistence/task/persist_refresh.clj` (refresh scheduling and execution)
  - `/src/metabase/model_persistence/settings.clj` (configuration settings)
  - `/src/metabase/driver/ddl/interface.clj` (database-specific persistence operations)

  The investigation focused on understanding:
  - How models are defined and persisted
  - The persistence process flow
  - How refreshes are scheduled and executed
  - State management during the persistence lifecycle
  - Database interactions for materialized views/tables

  ## 7. Optional Next Step:

  Since the conversation has been entirely focused on understanding Metabase's implementation details rather than making changes, and the last
  topic (data model persistence) was explored comprehensively, there are no explicit next steps tied to ongoing work. The user would need to
  specify a new area of interest or request a specific task before proceeding.
  </summary>.
  Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you
  were asked to work on.

⏺ Based on my exploration of the codebase, I can provide a comprehensive overview of how semantic search is implemented in Metabase:

  Semantic Search Implementation in Metabase

  Metabase has a proof-of-concept (POC) implementation of semantic code search that allows users to search through the Clojure codebase using
  natural language queries. Here's how it works:

  Components and Architecture

  1. Code Extraction:
    - Uses clj-kondo to analyze the Clojure codebase and extract function definitions
    - Extracts both standard function definitions and defmethod implementations
    - Eliminates duplicate functions with the same name, location, or content hash
  2. Text Embeddings:
    - Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model to generate vector embeddings for each function
    - Each function is represented as a high-dimensional vector (1536 dimensions) that captures its semantic meaning
  3. Vector Database:
    - Uses ChromaDB as a vector database to store and query the embeddings
    - Maintains a persistent collection in a SQLite database (chroma.sqlite3)
    - Stores function metadata alongside embeddings (namespace, name, filename, line numbers)
  4. Query Processing:
    - Converts natural language queries into the same vector space using the same embedding model
    - Computes similarity between the query vector and all function vectors
    - Returns the most semantically similar functions based on vector distance

  Implementation Files

  1. Outline Document: /Users/tplude/code/metabase/semantic-search-poc-outline.md
    - Contains the step-by-step implementation plan for the POC
    - Outlines the architecture and components
  2. Python Implementation: /Users/tplude/code/metabase/tsp-repos/embeddings-code-search/
    - main.py: Core implementation with functions for extraction, embedding, and loading into ChromaDB
    - search.py: Handles search queries, including embedding generation and similarity search
    - Various JSON files containing extracted functions and their embeddings
  3. Database: /Users/tplude/code/metabase/chroma_db/ and /Users/tplude/code/metabase/tsp-repos/embeddings-code-search/chroma_db/
    - Contains the ChromaDB vector database (SQLite-based)
    - Stores function embeddings and metadata for efficient similarity search

  Usage Flow

  1. Code Analysis:
  clj-kondo --config '{:analysis true :output {:format :json}}' --lint src/metabase/ > metabase.json
  2. Function Extraction:
  python main.py extract metabase.json --output chunks.json
  3. Embedding Generation:
  python main.py embed chunks.json --output embeddings.json
  4. Loading into Vector DB:
  python main.py load embeddings.json --db-path ./chroma_db
  5. Semantic Search:
  python main.py search "how to render a PNG image" --n-results 5

  Key Features

  1. Natural Language Queries: Users can search using plain English questions rather than exact keywords or regex patterns
  2. Semantic Understanding: Finds functions that conceptually match the query, even if they don't contain the exact terms
  3. Context-Aware Results: Returns the complete function definition with source location information
  4. Configurable Results: Adjustable number of results and flexible embedding model options

  Current Status

  This appears to be a functional proof-of-concept implementation. Based on the files and code samples, it's actively being used and tested but
  may not be fully integrated into the main Metabase application yet. The note in the README mentioning "Next Steps" suggests future plans for
  integration:

  - Implementation as a full MCP server for direct integration with Claude Code
  - Test what impact this has on claude's ability to answer vague backend questions

  The system is specifically focused on searching the Clojure backend codebase, not the frontend JavaScript/TypeScript code or user data content.
